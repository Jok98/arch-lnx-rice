- When I ask you to modify the Hyprland environment or its components to work under the arch-lnx-rice directory, make the change and apply it with export-config.sh. If the change concerns Zsh, use apply-zsh-config.sh instead.
- Always check if there are errors logged in hyprlad environment.
- Always take a look at the hyperland wiki https://wiki.hypr.land
